description : Disruptive

First I saw tweets about [beaker browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) so I installed it and then forget it. Then I saw this talk [**Imagine This: A Web Without Servers** by Tara Vancil at JSConf EU 2018](https://2018.jsconf.eu/speakers/tara-vancil-imagine-this-a-web-without-servers.html). And I remembered again. **dat://** a protocol to allow a P2P web to exist. A concept of a fully distributed web where the architecture works without servers so to say or where every device may become a server.

Just to try this out, I configured this website on **dat://**. [Setting DNS records](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/guides/use-a-domain-name-with-dat#dat-dns-txt-records) is easy as adding my address b3ad7ca317fb128838497e911262d4b18be3a09e6d7545ff0aed6488d2db9938 in a TXT DNS record. So just visit my website on [dat://zufrieden.io](dat://zufrieden.io).
