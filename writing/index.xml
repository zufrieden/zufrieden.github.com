      <description>There is this article I keep refering to. A good narative and some choice for you to make at the end. On which Internet you aspire to build, which Internet you&amp;rsquo;d like to have. Well &amp;ldquo;The Internet for people&amp;rdquo;.
Go dig in : Web Design: The First 100 Years
 When we point out that Silicon Valley doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be engaging the real world, that wages have been flat for thirty years, that Utopia seems further away than it&amp;rsquo;s been in a generation, we get impatient excuses.</description>

      <description>The web is so simple yet we often create cumbersome solutions. When the Developer Experience is balanced over User Experience, we may lose what&amp;rsquo;s valuable in the process. This talk will try to look at my brief web history to find patterns and loops.
Building a more resilient web, understanding the value of the web and how we build a more sustainable heritage. I consider myself a web dinosaur, let&amp;rsquo;s not condemn ourself to quickly to extinction.</description>

      <title>How and why asking for help</title>

      <description>Asking for help is fine We tend to not ask for help. Usually because it transmit the idea of a weak person. It may expose our weakness right. But human being likes to help and saying you need some help is a good honest gesture. Because you can&amp;rsquo;t do everything alone right.
3 reinforcements that helps to get buys-in  Being part of the group is something you have to consider when asking for help.</description>

      <description>First I saw tweets about beaker browser so I installed it and then forget it. Then I saw this talk Imagine This: A Web Without Servers by Tara Vancil at JSConf EU 2018. And I remembered again. dat:// a protocol to allow a P2P web to exist. A concept of a fully distributed web where the architecture works without servers so to say or where every device may become a server.</description>

      <description>Seeking the right role for an Entrepeneur  becoming an observer instead of an active participant in your business Entrepreneurship is really just a fancy word for delegation   &amp;ldquo;My company felt like an unmanned car, slowly swerving into the ditch only to be pulled backâ€Šâ€”â€Šusually by meâ€Šâ€”â€Šat the last second.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Many CEOâ€™s forget this and get stuck in sales, marketing, productâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhatever part of the business they loveâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhile they ignore the bigger picture.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s quite hard for a first post to choose a topic. I was used to blog a lot 6 years ago. My topics of choice were mainly webdesign, xhtml, css, my student life and so on. I stopped for many reasons (personal life, moving a year to finland, building my company) but since I like sharing things and collecting thoughs about by day and night work. I am here to share.</description>
