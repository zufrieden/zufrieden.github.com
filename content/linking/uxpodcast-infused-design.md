We can identify business value by asking the following questions about the end results of our project:

  1. Will it increase revenue?
  1. Will it decrease expenses?
  1. Will it bring in new customers?
  1. Will it bring in more money from existing customers?
  1. Will it increase shareholder/taxpayer value?
