Being lucky enough to travel to Japan twice. I can't wait going back. And obsessively take aside every article mentioning it.

Fascination for the culture, the food, the landscape, the organisation, the history, the geography and so on. Being outside of this world, don't want to touch anything but at the same time dive into it head first. With the most respectful behaviour. 

### So here are the collected links :

- [The Glorious, Almost-Disconnected Boredom of My Walk in Japan](https://www.wired.com/story/six-weeks-100s-miles-hours-glorious-boredom-japan/ "Wired article by Craig Mod")
- [These photos are why Iâ€™m trapped in Tokyo forever now](https://medium.com/@damjancvetkovdimitrov/these-photos-are-why-i-m-trapped-in-tokyo-forever-now-1a0ea980bcc5)
- [Teachings From Japanese Craftsmanship: What Is Enough?](https://www.gchicco.com/2019/11/14/teaching-from-japanese-craftsmanship-what-is-enough/)

I'll try to add some more.
