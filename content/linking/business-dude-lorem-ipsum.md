Love this part of the article :

> My guess is that nobody knows what the piece says or how to paraphrase it (because there’s no actual substance), but people are sharing it for the same reason it was written—as a way to discuss a subject without having to think about the subject in any meaningful way. This is what you share when you barge into a meeting and hurriedly ask, “I’m hearing a lot about this metaverse. What’s our metaverse strategy?”
