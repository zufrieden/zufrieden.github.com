description = "Over 15 years, average website weight has grown from about 400 KB to 4 MB. In fact, most websites I come across are 6, 8, 10 or 15 MB plus per page. There’s no need for this weight. It’s just laziness, poor, arrogant Web design. It’s a climate crisis and Web designers are pouring petrol on the fire. Marketers are flooding the Web with junk. So many organizations are publishing vast quantities of low-quality content, and then leaving it there to rot and cause pollution. 90% of data has no use. Adtech is like the oil industry of the Internet."
