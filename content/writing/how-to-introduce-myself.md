## Coming back to Mastodon, I need to write my Bio.

Not so often, I need to write about myself. I'm turning slowly toward Mastodon instead of Twitter as I praise a decentralized web. So it's time again to write a Bio.
Not a talented writer and even worst when I have to talk about myself. I have to explain why it might be interesting to follow me.
