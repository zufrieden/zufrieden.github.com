## Asking for help is fine

We tend to not ask for help. Usually because it transmit the idea of a weak person. It may expose our weakness right. But human being likes to help and saying you need some help is a good honest gesture. Because you can't do everything alone right.

## 3 reinforcements that helps to get buys-in

1. **Being part of the group** is something you have to consider when asking for help. Emphasis to being part of this team with past experience, common goal and interest.
2. **Positive attitude** toward the person you request help. Telling her she's the right person to help.
3. **Efficience** and impact is really important. Make sure to communicate the result of the help.


## What helpers needs to know/understand

Also when asking for help you have to make sure the person you ask :

1. Understand that you need help.
2. Understand that you want some help.
3. Being concerned by the subject (feeling responsible).
4. Being skilled to help.
