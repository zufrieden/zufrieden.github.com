It's quite hard for a first post to choose a topic. I was used to blog a lot 6 years ago. My topics of choice were mainly webdesign, xhtml, css, my student life and so on. I stopped for many reasons (personal life, moving a year to finland, building my company) but since I like sharing things and collecting thoughs about by day and night work. I am here to share.

## So back to this post about working environment

We all have our weapons of choice to code and design. I was a textmate addict and switched to SublimeText a few months ago. I am always impress by developers masterising their tools especialy when tools's learning curves are long. So speaking of SublimeText, which I really enjoy working with, I have the goal to backup and share my configuration on github.

## Packages for a frontend web developer

Working on several projects with different frameworks, languages and constraints is somehow challenging. So SublimeText through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) allow you to find and install quite easily any color scheme or plugin.

## My preferences file
