description = "In this episode Matt and Mike sit down with Chris Ferdinandi to discuss the current state of JavaScript and more specifically why Chris thinks that it's ruining the web as we know it. JavaScript has exploded in popularity over the past few years and with that a rush of new developer talent has adopted the likes of JavaScript frameworks (ie React, Vue) to spin up projects quickly and easily, even if they're not that big (ie a landing page). In addition to this conversation, the trio discuss the importance of documentation, accessibility, and more!"
